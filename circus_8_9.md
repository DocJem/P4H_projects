By using a windlass, the nested sections were elevated to a great height, showing gold and silver carving, mirrors, and allegorical paintings.
This display of grandeur started an era which could be called The Golden Age of the Circus Parade. Other Circuses jumped into the market, and American designers and artists accepted the challenge; thus the great and historical Wagons, which hold such an important place in the life and lore of the circus, came into being in this highly competitive era of the circus,
